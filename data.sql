difficulties, the first is extremely high altitude and lack of oxygen, extreme
storms of several days duration resulting in several deaths, and  lastly steep
and exposed nature of routes. The standard route used is Abruzzi Spur which is
used by 75  percent of the climbers. There are series of rocks, snow and  ice,
