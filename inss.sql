orld and the cultural hub in Pakistan. A vibrant city packed with music, architecture and 
gastonomic delights. There you could visit sites such as: Badshahi Mosque, Masjid Waziristan,
 Lahore Fort Shalimar Gardens. It is widely considered the country's cultural capital. 
 The heart of Lahore is the Walled or Inner City, a very densely populated area of about 
 one square kilometre. Founded in legendary times, and a cultural centre for over a thousand 
 years, Lahore has many attractions to keep the tourist busy. The Mughal and Sikh legacy 
 survives in the Lahore Fort, Badshahi Mosque and Gurdwara, the Mall is lined with 
 colonial-gothic buildings from the British Raj, and the suburbs of Gulberg and Defence 
 feature palatial mansions and trendy shopping districts.Lahore is the second largest city 
 in Pakistan with a population of roughly 8.5 million. The traditional capital of Punjab 
 for a thousand years, it had been the cultural center of Northern India extending from 
 Peshawar to New Delhi. The origins of Lahore are shrouded in the myths of antiquity but 
 Lahore is undoubtedly ancient. Today, Lahore is certainly worth a visit - but don't
  come expecting a tranquil city overflowing with history, art and culture - 
  these qualities do exist but are hidden under the surface of a sprawling south 
  Asian city. Forward planning is recommended if the tourist is going to get the 
  most out of what Lahore has to offer - the time of year to visit, the choice of 
  hotel, the restaurants to dine at, the art galleries and the shopping areas to 
  frequent are all key to getting the most out of your stay."),

According to Hindu legends, it was the capital of the Trigarta Kingdom at the time of the Mahabharata war, ruled by the Katoch Dynasty. Its current name is derived from the Sanskrit name Mulasthana named after a sun temple. Multan has frequently been a site of conflict due to its location on a major invasion route between South Asia and Central Asia. It is believed to have been visited by Alexander the Great's army.

 Modern Multan was founded by the Sufi Saint Syed Shah Yousaf Gardez upon his arrival from Gardez Afganistan. Multan was conquered along with Sindh by Muhammad bin Qasim, from the local ruler Chach of Alor. Following bin Qasim's conquest, the city was securely under Muslim rule, although it was in effect an independent state and most of the subjects were non-Muslim. The British held it from 1848 until Pakistan achieved independence in 1947.It initially lacked industry, hospitals and universities. Since then, there has been some industrial growth, and the city's population is continually growing. But the old city continues to be in a dilapidated state, and many monuments wear the effects of the warfare that has visited the city.

The administrative centre of Gilgit was an important city on the Silk Road, through which Buddhism was spread from India to the rest of Asia. A large number of Buddhist Sanskrit texts, including the long version of the Heart Sutra have been unearthed in Gilgit. The Dards and Cizinas also appear in many of the old Pauranic lists of peoples, with the former finding mention in Ptolemy's accounts of the region. Two famous travellers, Faxian and Hsuan Tsang, are known to have traversed Gilgit as per their accounts. Gilgit was ruled for centuries by the local Trakane Dynasty, which came to an end in about 1810. The area descended into internecine turmoil before being occupied by the Sikhs in 1842. It was ceded to Jammu in 1846. Gilgit's inhabitants drove their new rulers out in an uprising in 1852. The Khushwakhte Dynasty of Yasin and Gulapure led the people of Gilgit to drive out the Dogra rulers. After Yasin was conquered by the Katur Dynasty of Chitral, the power of the Khushwakhte was crushed. The rule of Jammu was restored in 1860. Gilgit came under British rule in 1889, when it was unified with neighbouring Hunza and Nagar in the Gilgit Agency. When British rule came to an end in 1947 and British India was granted independence and divided into India and Pakistan. However, the British failed to negotiate the freedom of independent states, who signed a treaty with the British, like Jammu and Kashmir, Hyderabad, Junagadh, Swat, Balochistan etc. So, Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir, Hari Singh reigned over the region and claimed it to be independent of the two nations. In 1947, a tribal uprising which led to Indo-Pakistan war of 1947 took place and Hari Singh joined the Indian Union. However, following the tribal uprising the state of Jammu and Kashmir was divided and the region came under Pakistani control. The region is claimed both by India and Pakistan and is termed as the Kashmir conflict.")
